# VAU1-Brain-Polycomb-ncRNA-2025
Polycomb is a set of proteins that regulate gene expression, especially in the human brain. They form long-range DNA loops between genes, and those loops spread gene repression programs. However, many loops are formed not between genes, but between some non-coding RNAs. Maybe some of them are brain-specific and/or have interesting functions?
